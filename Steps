Steps:

Import Data
o Used Mushroom dataset from the UCI ML Repository
Split data into training and testing
o Out of 8124 samples, Used top 4000 instance for training & rest for testing.
Calculate the probability of the individual features P(A)
o Calculate the probability of the occurrences of the feature
Calculate the probability of the features with respect to the output 𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)
o Calculate the Probability of the occurrence of the feature given occurrence of output
Calculate the probability of the test sample using Bayes theorem, 𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) = (𝑃(𝐵/A)*𝑃(A))/𝑃(B)
Based on the probability predict the outcome for the test set.
Calculate Accuracy by (TP+TN)/(TP+ FP+ FN+TN) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 error 𝑏𝑦 (FP+ FN)/(TP+ FP+ FN+TN)
